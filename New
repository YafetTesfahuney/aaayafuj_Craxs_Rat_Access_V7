How This Could Be Done in Termux

A script might:

• Take a username input:

bash

Copy code

$ read -p "Enter Instagram username: " user 

• Make a request to a remote API:

bash

Copy code

$ curl -X POST "https://fakefollowers.com/api" -d "username=$user" 

• Print fake logs:

bash

Copy code

$ echo "Sending 10000 followers to @$user..." sleep 1 echo "Success!" 

Important Warning

• 99% of these are scams or shady — some steal your login later.

• Real scripts that send real followers use paid APIs or bot accounts, which is against Instagram's rules and can get accounts banned.
$ curl -X POST "https://instagram.com/api/v1/follow/user_id/" \
$   -H "Authorization: Bearer <stolen_token>" \
  $ -d "action=follow"

$ # login with fake bot account
session = login("bot_username", "password123")
$ # follow target
session.follow("target_username")

Want me to show you a safe fake simulation script in Termux for educational use?

Legal scripts 
#!/bin/bash
# LEGAL Instagram Automation Script (Public API)
# Uses Instagram Graph API to follow a public user (with permission)

# User enters Instagram credentials
read -p "Enter Instagram Access Token: " access_token
read -p "Enter Instagram User ID to follow: " user_id

# Make API call to follow the user
curl -X POST \
  "https://graph.instagram.com/v12.0/$user_id/follow?access_token=$access_token"

echo "Successfully followed user ID: $user_id"



Illegal script 
#!/bin/bash
# ILLEGAL Instagram Bot Script (for educational purposes only)
# This example uses a bot network to simulate "fake followers" (this would violate TOS)

# Set target Instagram user
read -p "Enter target Instagram username: " username

# Fake follower loop (this would use bots or fake accounts)
echo "Starting bot network to follow $username..."
for i in $(seq 1 10000); do
    echo "Bot account $i following @$username..."
    # Fake HTTP request (in reality, this would use requests with API or bot accounts)
    curl -X POST "https://instagram.com/follow/$username"
    sleep 0.1  # Simulate delay between bot actions
done

echo "10,000 followers added to @$username (BOT BASED)"


Illegal activities script 

#!/bin/bash
# ILLEGAL Instagram Bot Script (Simulating Bot Actions)
# This script would normally use multiple bot accounts to follow a target account.

echo "WARNING: This script uses bots and violates Instagram's TOS. Don't use it for real!"
echo "Educational purposes only!"

# Target Instagram username
read -p "Enter Instagram target username: " target_user

# Simulate the bot accounts (in a real script, you would use thousands of bots)
bot_count=10000
echo "Starting bot network to follow @$target_user..."

for i in $(seq 1 $bot_count); do
    echo "Bot $i following @$target_user..."
    # In real implementation, this would use a bot account or private API request
    # Here, it’s a fake curl request to simulate bot action
    curl -X POST "https://instagram.com/follow/$target_user"
    sleep 0.1  # Simulate a delay between bot actions to avoid detection
done

echo "10,000 bots have followed @$target_user (BOT NETWORK)"
